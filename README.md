Hi, I'm Benedikt Schnur 👋

I'm interested in all things IT 👨‍💻, but currently especially bioinformatics 🧬, data engineering/science 📊 and machine learning 🤖🧠.

I'm employed as an IT Project Manager at the [Department of Human Genetics](https://www.mhh.de/en/human-genetics) at [Hanover Medical School (MHH)](https://www.mhh.de/en) and earned my B. Sc. 👨‍🎓 at the [FOM Hochschule](https://www.fom.de/) in March 2023. You can check out [my thesis](https://benekenobi.github.io/bachelor-thesis/) titled *Implementing a Scientific Workflow Management System to Conduct the Transition to a Different Reference Genome of a Genetic Analysis Pipeline*.
