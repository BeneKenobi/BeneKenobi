Hi, I'm @BeneKenobi 👋

I'm interested in all things IT 👨‍💻, but currently especially bioinformatics 🧬, data science 📊 and machine learning 🤖🧠.

I'm employed as an IT Project Manager at the [Department of Human Genetics](https://www.mhh.de/en/human-genetics) at [Hanover Medical School (MHH)](https://www.mhh.de/en) and studying at the [FOM Hochschule](https://www.fom.de/) to get my Bachelor of Science in Business IT 👨‍🎓.
