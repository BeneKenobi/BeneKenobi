Hi, I'm Benedikt Schnur 👋

👨‍💻 As an avid IT enthusiast with a focus on bioinformatics 🧬, data science 📊, and machine learning 🤖🧠, I excel in turning complex data into actionable insights 💡. I'm steering impactful projects at the [Department of Human Genetics](https://www.mhh.de/en/human-genetics) at [Hanover Medical School (MHH)](https://www.mhh.de/en), where technology meets medical innovation 🔬.

🎓 I hold a B.Sc. from [FOM Hochschule](https://www.fom.de/), where my thesis 📄 bridged the gap between IT 💻 and genetics research 🧫, streamlining processes and embedding best practices—[take a peek here](https://benekenobi.github.io/bachelor-thesis/). Now, I'm expanding my academic foundation 📚 by pursuing an M.Sc. in [*Biomedizinische Informatik und Data Science*](https://www.master-bids.de/) at the [Hochschule Mannheim](https://www.hs-mannheim.de/) alongside my professional career 💼 complementing my ongoing work.

🛠️ Currently, diving into the world of Rust 🦀 is broadening my technical repertoire, embracing its renowned performance and safety for future projects. My toolkit includes Python 🐍, where I often harness the power of Jupyter Notebooks 📓 for in-depth data analysis, R for statistical computing 📊, TypeScript for robust type-checking ⌨️, and React Native for mobile app development 📱. My web development is enhanced with HTML5 🌐, and containerization skills with Docker 🐳 and Singularity 📦 ensure my applications are both portable and scalable. Cloud computing is another forte, with several projects powered by AWS and Google Cloud's ☁️ robust platforms.

My enthusiasm thrives on uniting IT 💻 and healthcare 🏥, crafting data-driven solutions that are integral to advancing patient treatment and biomedical research, as a fundamental pillar for the future of health services.
